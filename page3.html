                    <h2>My Plans</h2>
                    <p>My plan right now is to get a web development certificate from Neumont College of Computer Science, and find a good job in California to be closer to Spencer. We will then get married. As he finishes up his schooling, I'll be building my career as a bomb-a web developer. Once he finishes school, we'll start our family together and live happily ever after.</p>
