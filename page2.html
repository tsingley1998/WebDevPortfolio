                    <h2>Where Have I been?</h2>
                    <p>I haven't actually been many places, but these are just a few of my favorite places in the world. In my list of my favorite sites, I've included several links to sources that can tell you more about each place. Enjoy!</p>

                        <li><a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g60795-Activities-Philadelphia_Pennsylvania.html" target="_blank">Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</a>- My dad grew up here, and my Grammie still lives there. I love to go and visit her, as well as see the many historical sites it has to offer.</li>
                        <li><a href="http://arkansasbentonvillemission-loveland.weebly.com/" target="_blank">Bentonville, Arkansas</a>- I had the opportunity to serve a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Bentonville. I met so many amazing people and made the best memories there.</li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g33224-Activities-Victorville_California.html" target="_blank">Victorville, California</a>- I love Victorville because that is where Spencer and his family live. It's also in Southern California which means minimal snow!</li>
                        <li><a href="https://broadway.showtickets.com/all-new-york-shows/" target="_blank">New York City, New York</a>- I actually hated New York City, but I included it because when we visited, we saw Wicked on Broadway. That was always a dream of mine. It met every expectation too, but now that it is fulfilled, I wouldn't mind if I<br> just never went back.</li>
