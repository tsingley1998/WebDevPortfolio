                    <h2>Movies</h2>
                    <p>These movies are all ones I greatly enjoy watching. <em>13 Going on 30</em> and <em>Back to the Future</em> are on my list for mainly nostalgic reasons. I grew up watching them, and they always remind me of my childhood. <em>Captain America</em> is one of my favorite super heros, and <em>Infinity War</em> is just a fantastic movie. <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> trilogy is mostly nostalgic as well, because it's a film my family and I have enjoyed for forever. I would recommend all of these movies to whoever is reading this, because they are amazing.</p>

                    <h2>TV Shows</h2>
                    <p>TV shows. My FAVORITE time waster. I recently went on a trip to visit my boyfriend Spencer and his family in California, and we watched all three seasons of <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> within the week. Impressive or sad? I'm not sure either. I mostly value humor when I'm watching shows, but I do like the occasional drama. Hence the presence of <em>Outlander</em> and <em>The Mandalorian</em>on my list. Do I even need to explain the otehr two? Pure gold.</p>

                    <p>Not much of an explaination needed here other than I like what I like and that's what I like. Like it or not.</p>
